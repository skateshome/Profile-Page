        <h2>Why Now?</h2>
        <p>After working in my first "career" job as a claims adjuster for Progressive insurance for the better part of a decade....it was time for a change.   </p>
        <p>That change proved to be very worthwhile as I moved into sales.  For just over 20 years now I have worked with a very succeful company selling office equipmnent and technology.  However, after much consideration...it is time for a change again.</p>
        <p>I believe I can bring a "customers" prospetive to my new career in Web Development and Design.  I have over 30 years experience in actually dealing with real people and can bring a unigue prospective, warts and all!</p>
